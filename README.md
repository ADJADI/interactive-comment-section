## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application designed to manage comments and user interactions. It features user authentication, comment voting, and editing functionality, all built with a modern tech stack.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [docker](https://www.docker.com) - container platform
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) - database
- [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) - schema-based solution to model your application data
- [Apollo client](https://mongoosejs.com) - comprehensive state management library for JavaScript
- [Tailwindcss]- For styles

### What I learned

- Since it's was my first time working on the backend of an app that helped me a lot about the understanding of my frontend, when you see the other side you know much more about the direction that you should take with your code.
- I learned how to create a schema with graphql/apolloclient
- I learned how to create query type mutation and how to use it after in my client side

### Continued development

Since it was my first full-stack app I really look forward to start a new project and learn more. I really want to keep going learning about mongoDB and apolloClient those two combined are very useful and I have a lot's more to discover.

### Useful resources

- [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-community-with-docker/) - This helped me to install docker, create my database and make it run smoothly.
- [APOLLO documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) - This is an amazing documentation very fast forward and clear
